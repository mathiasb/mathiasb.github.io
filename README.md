### DevOps practices
I'm an experienced non-func tester with a focus on low latency, throughtput, scalability and robustness, and DevOps is close to my heart. I see DevOps as a part of the holistic craft of developing effective and usable systems. So these are some practices I use and would like to share.

#### README-driven Development
After analysing the main requirements and use case for a project, and I can conclude that it's likely a quite isolated component that needs to be built, or a smaller app/feature, then I think it can be useful to let README-driven development principles guide. You can read a great article about it here:
* [https://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html]
* [https://www.agilelonestar.com/knowledge-base/rdd]

This is an example project where I used 'RDD' to quickly put together a Slack App based on Node.JS to enable Google Bard integration with our company's resarch process.

#### Branching and deploying
I guess it's more of a cultural thing almost, and also related to the project at hand (and team assigned to take on the project). When I crunch away on individual projects (which is most of my time since leaving the full time programmer profession), I tend to want to keep things quite lean and simple, and the work within very few branches. This feels natural as there is not so much coordination needed for the development (just me mostly, right!).
